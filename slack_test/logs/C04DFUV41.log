1471848932.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hi <@U23D8HAC9> I am currently testing the GitHub's `milestone` functionality. So you’ll find it here : <https://github.com/echopen/android-app/milestones>. If you want we can even schedule a dev plan for this milestones. What do you think ?
1471849050.000004> @U0B47KC3S: also could you give me your GitHub username so that I can invite you on echOpen’s github organization
1471856199.000002> @U23D8HAC9: Yeah its great, let's get started.  My github username is 'nameispriyank'
1471859307.000003> @U0B47KC3S: you’re in our github team :wink: btw, for the images ressources, we can fake them for the moment with some available pictos. We’ll make the design in a few weeks with a dedicated designer !
1472021317.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hi Pryiank, the Image Processing team is going to use <http://www.zube.io>, you know about this tool ?

1476716909.000006> @U2Q4137LL: Ok merci
1478001538.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hello <@U2Q4137LL> : en regardant les templates `psd`, je constate que la gesture n’est pas intégrée directement sur le screen. Or,il se trouve qu’il y a une solution qui semble être saluée comme un breakthrough par les designers et qui est intégrée à Invision v5. Je te laisse checker : <http://blog.invisionapp.com/mobile-prototyping-for-ios-and-android-is-now-instant-offline-and-awesome/>  Peux-tu me faire un retour dès que tu peux ? dans la vue du workshop de jeudi à Africa4Tech
1478003690.000002> @U2Q4137LL: Dans les vues invision j'ai déjà intégré les mouvements sur certains boutons quand c'était possible. Quand il n'y pas d'animation c'est que les mouvements proposés sans passer par la version payante ne correspondaient pas.  C'est pour ça que dans le zip il y a toutes les vues avec un texte explicatif sur la gesture à côté.  Au fait la version psd avec tous les éléments séparés n'est pas encore uploader, on hésiter hier entre github ou le drive, du coup je la met ou?
1478005056.000003> @U0B47KC3S: peux-tu me dire les possibilités supplémentaires qu’offre la version payante, dans notre contexte ? par ailleurs <@U04DFTZ7D> pour le choix drive vs github - j’ai un penchant pour drive;)
1478006648.000004> @U2Q4137LL: Sur le site ils ne précisent pas, ils disent juste qu'il y a plus de prototype et options. Mais dans notre cas je ne vois trop d'intérêt, on a très peu d'écrans et animations différentes donc rien qui ne soit compréhensible rapidement par le texte explicatif ou à l'oral
1478024653.000002> @U0B47KC3S: ok on fait comme ça
1478024978.000003> @U0AAL4W13: Niveau stockage de document on a eu cette discussion encore récemment à une réunion du lundi, c'est pas mal de laisser les fichiers accessible au public sur un repo git 
1478024980.000004> @U0AAL4W13: D'autant plus que ça permet de garder le versioning même des fichiers design 
1478025071.000005> @U0AAL4W13: Sachant que l'accès au drive est moins ouvert
1478025106.000006> @U0AAL4W13: Et que pour un camp c'est facile de partager un repo et collecter les contributions de manière visible 
1478201353.000002> @U0B47KC3S: en cours sur un repo qu’on va publier incessamment

1479304208.000005> @U0B47KC3S: <@U04DFTZ7D> <@U0GMX7QUB> I have just pushed on my forked repo of the app, a suggestion of documentation architecture and first examples of what could be the modules and interfaces markdown. What do you think ?
1479304209.000006> @U0B47KC3S: <https://github.com/benchoufi/android-app/tree/master/app/src/main/assets>
1479304348.000008> @U0B47KC3S: [FYI] for all, to explain the precedent post, we are testing a documentation format and for that purpose we attach to some folder of the app, some markdowns files. The idea is that these files will be processed by some script in order to deploy auto-magically the app documentation, at a higher and more intelligible level than a doxygen like doc
1479306187.000010> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U0B47KC3S> looks great and clear !! Just, i don't know why the markdown format don't show up properly when i try to read the MDL-user_interface.   I let <@U0GMX7QUB> telling you about the structure for the automatic website.
1479306288.000011> @U0B47KC3S: what do you mean by they don’t show up properly ?
1479306689.000012> @U04DFTZ7D: Github manage preview of mardown files without showing up the structure of the document. I attached examples

1481936592.000028> @U0B47KC3S: 4 those working on `Vulkan` for `Android`, you should
1481936596.000029> @U0B47KC3S: 1) use last version of `gradle` compiler
1481936599.000030> @U0B47KC3S: 2) Upgrade to last version of Android Studio
1481936614.000031> @U0B47KC3S: 3) If you’re stick with older version such as `1.2.1`, then Android Studio will complain to find `cmake` despite you install latest `SDK Tools` or `SDK build tools`. However, there is a quick fix referenced here &lt;https://github.com/Commit451/android-cmake-installer&gt;
1481936619.000032> @U0B47KC3S: *Remark* It is a known issue of google’s android studio team, which was fixed in latest version

1482005720.000041> @U0B47KC3S: <@U37GZRZU6> <@U1PKXQVDW> after 2 checks, no working Nexus are available on my side :thinking_face:
1482016155.000043> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0B47KC3S> on my side neither... :disappointed:
1482016919.000044> @U0B47KC3S: hey <@U37GZRZU6> there is something in between CPU and GPU usages which is RenderScript. It allows parallel processing. The only thing is we can’t force the code to use either one or another, it is low level OS choice who allocates ressources accordingly to the availibilties. But it seems to be broadly supported from `Jelly Bean` API 16 :wink: And there is a bunch of publications documenting the power of this framework in parallel processing contexts :wink: I am currently jumping in the doc
1482017318.000045> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0B47KC3S> that's great if you found an alternative :slightly_smiling_face: actually I was just thinking, if Vulkan forces people to update to the last Android device / OS then it's not suited for echOpen anyway... right ? The most important criterion to chose the right API is whether it can be widespread or not...
1482017943.000051> @U0B47KC3S: exact <@U37GZRZU6>
1482017948.000052> @U0B47KC3S: 1) the thing is that Google claimed that it is strategic for them to develop an equivalent of IOS’s metal, which is widely supported on IOS devices. So for 2 years, it is announced to be a core evolution of android and supposed to be as widely supported as IOS metal, so that it can meet echOpen’s criterion. Those kind of announces can lead to fast move and quick uptake for the android devices park. But, today’s experience can lead us sure to have a close look on these evolutions but not to rely on this and move forward to another way of hacking around the thing. In between, OpenCL set aside and Vulkan promise, there could be a good alternative in RenderScript (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1482017950.000053> @U0B47KC3S: 2) Btw, guess what, I installed thsi google samples, and this time it work like a charm <https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BasicRenderScript> So that we can begin working on it !
1482018889.000055> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0B47KC3S> thanks a lot !! seems to run on my side as well... can't wait tomorrow to play with it :slightly_smiling_face:
1482023408.000056> @U0B47KC3S: <@U2PFHNN3C> <@U37GZRZU6> <#C1G7T0PNX> look at this
1482023412.000057> @U0B47KC3S: 1) this is called CNNdroid
1482023416.000058> @U0B47KC3S: 2) It is "GPU-Accelerated Execution of Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on Android”
1482023420.000059> @U0B47KC3S: 3) and it uses `RenderScript`!
1482023422.000060> @U0B47KC3S: Published 2 months ago, and Open Source t <https://github.com/ENCP/CNNdroid>
1482075564.000062> @U3FCS2UP3: For me the renderscript examples work as well! So what exactly are the computations that need to be ported to the App?
1482108587.000063> @U0B47KC3S: <@U37GZRZU6> <@U3FCS2UP3> I have just pushed the last version and here is the current state :
1482108592.000064> @U0B47KC3S: 1) It’s working :wink:
1482108597.000065> @U0B47KC3S: 2) We have a pretty good performance of 1,4µs per frame which can let us hope of 70 frames per second for simple images !!
1482108601.000066> @U0B47KC3S: But
1482108608.000067> @U0B47KC3S: 3) The image is slightly noisy, I don’t understand why. You have an idea ?
1482108619.000068> @U0B47KC3S: 4) The code can be still optimized : in fact, I didn’t use the `rs_allocation` because I can’t get the index of the rs_allocation being parsed (the index not the counter). So how to do that ? RenderScript is still poorly documented
1482108623.000069> @U0B47KC3S: btw <@U3FCS2UP3> what I understand is that the loop of the kernel methods which are taken in charge by RenderScript's internals are not the natural increasing order, but rather randomly, which I think explain the images that we got earlier
1482108640.000070> @U0B47KC3S: 5) Btw, when the RenderScript algo will be optimized, I ll make some clean up code to throw out all the allocation in a more static context so that it doesn’t have to be parsed at each loop
1482139231.000074> @U37GZRZU6: you rock <@U0B47KC3S> :wink: I'll have look at the last version, hopefully this evening. BTW, I just told our lead dev about Renderscript, first time of my life I teach him something about Androïd :sunglasses: (reactions: @U0B47KC3S,@U0AAL4W13)

1482189353.000077> @U0B47KC3S: <@U37GZRZU6> yes I use an emulator with API 25, it should not depend on the device, however I use Galaxy Nexus. Could you tell us what you in the logs ? especially the ones marked in red with a thrown exception

1484730281.000117> @U0B47KC3S: hi <@U3QGT3Q74> sure there is also an online meeting ! we meet on skype at 6.30 pm, and generally at about 6.45/50 pm. Could you provide your skype id ?
1484735024.000118> @U3QGT3Q74: Skype id - clement.lecouedic I will do my best to join at Hotel-Dieu otherwise I will join online.

1484859431.000121> @U0B47KC3S: hi #channel : just to let you know that we have some jam coding session this saturday afternoon, playing around GPU and renderscript with some echTopians -&gt; <@U37GZRZU6> and <@U3QGT3Q74>
1484859432.000122> @U0B47KC3S: On remote, or irl don’t hesitate to join :wink: (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1484860408.000124> @U3TUWV3SQ: Ok, if I have some free time, I will come. Thanks for the invitation
1484862112.000125> @U3QGT3Q74: Hi all, I will be available on Saturday in early afternoon. I gave a look a renderscript and it looks very promising in term of performances. I also want to mention ITK an other famous open source C++ framework specialized in medical imaging that could be compilated ans used in the Android NDK. It will probably not be as good as renderscript for perfs but it will provide many filters and renderers. Also it would be portable on both iOS and Android 
1484862484.000126> @U0B47KC3S: that’s interesting ! do you think we can implement renderscript + ITK, jus to get filters and renderers if these are necessary, and try to implement them progressively in GPU if there are paralellizable
1484997880.000127> @U3QGT3Q74: I think it's compatible yes. ITK provides automatic parallelization for most of the filters and I know some are also implemented with GPU  (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1484997914.000128> @U3QGT3Q74: I will investigate a bit more 
1484998342.000129> @U0B47KC3S: great :wink:
1484998590.000130> @U38HVMZ6K: For the reference... <https://itk.org/> I also had a quick look at it and seems really good. Well documented and maintained with regular releases. (reactions: @U0B47KC3S)
1485019903.000132> @U0B47KC3S: thanks <@U38HVMZ6K> we were just talking about it. Btw, we arben  trying now to document a robust rendering pipeline
1485020072.000133> @U0B47KC3S: besides, we are working with <@U37GZRZU6> on refactoring the code for the RenderScript implementation and we get for the only ScanConversion algo `6ms` :wink:
1485299669.000134> @U3QGT3Q74: <@U0B47KC3S> <@U37GZRZU6> Following our discussions from last saturday on the rendering pipeline I investigate on the communication part between the device and the mobile phone  * UDP protocol does not seems to be compatible with medical device as it allows packet loss during data transfert, we should focus on TCP/IP   * standard encoding for medical images is Lossless JPEG that ensure no image degradation with a compression factor between 6:1 to 12:1 (reactions: @U20C8CKTL,@U37GZRZU6)
1485299868.000135> @U0B47KC3S: indeed <@U3QGT3Q74>, there is a legacy UDP implementation related to first POCtotype, we used  this protocol for opportunity reason. Currently, we have a TCP implementation running fine
1485299913.000136> @U0B47KC3S: perfect for the JPEG implementation
1485300469.000137> @U20C8CKTL: Last year i saw something at fosdem on picotcp. Some kind of resized tcp/ip stack
1485300513.000138> @U20C8CKTL: Maybe it could be interesting to look at this stuff further.
1485335873.000139> @U0AAL4W13: BTW, were there minutes from Saturday?
1485335906.000140> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0AAL4W13> no... :sweat:
1485445049.000141> @U0B47KC3S: :point_up: <@U37GZRZU6> <@U3QGT3Q74> <@U2X7189QR> <@U3FCS2UP3> <@U2XLJS5L0>  I have just PR with a new branch `GPUrway`
1485445052.000142> @U0B47KC3S: You’ll find the app with RenderScript all together with OpenGL display machinery :wink: it is morning work so there is still some screen parameters to find tune in order to get a bigger picture, but it is speed and works like a charm :wink:
1485445054.000143> @U0B47KC3S: Morever you’ll find OpenGL test android app, a standalone one, in order to play with it without embrassing with the heavy echOpen’s app (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1485445754.000144> @U3QGT3Q74: <@U0B47KC3S> I'm currently setting up the mobile-app repository of the project. I will also give a look at GPUrway branch :wink:
1485447093.000145> @U0B47KC3S: <@U3QGT3Q74> great :wink: we agree that I am not an expert and so not quality code compliant :wink: pleasing myself with some code, that’s it

1485447414.000148> @U0B47KC3S: <@U3QGT3Q74>, btw I am thinking to add some lock because some part of code could be exposed to concurrency. We’ll discuss that matter
1485602861.000149> @U3QGT3Q74: <@U0B47KC3S> don't worry ;D the app is running that is the most important! we will improve some parts if needed
