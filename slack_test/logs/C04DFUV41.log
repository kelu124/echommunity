1471848932.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hi <@U23D8HAC9> I am currently testing the GitHub's `milestone` functionality. So you’ll find it here : <https://github.com/echopen/android-app/milestones>. If you want we can even schedule a dev plan for this milestones. What do you think ?
1471849050.000004> @U0B47KC3S: also could you give me your GitHub username so that I can invite you on echOpen’s github organization
1471856199.000002> @U23D8HAC9: Yeah its great, let's get started.  My github username is 'nameispriyank'
1471859307.000003> @U0B47KC3S: you’re in our github team :wink: btw, for the images ressources, we can fake them for the moment with some available pictos. We’ll make the design in a few weeks with a dedicated designer !
1472021317.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hi Pryiank, the Image Processing team is going to use <http://www.zube.io>, you know about this tool ?

1476716909.000006> @U2Q4137LL: Ok merci
1478001538.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hello <@U2Q4137LL> : en regardant les templates `psd`, je constate que la gesture n’est pas intégrée directement sur le screen. Or,il se trouve qu’il y a une solution qui semble être saluée comme un breakthrough par les designers et qui est intégrée à Invision v5. Je te laisse checker : <http://blog.invisionapp.com/mobile-prototyping-for-ios-and-android-is-now-instant-offline-and-awesome/>  Peux-tu me faire un retour dès que tu peux ? dans la vue du workshop de jeudi à Africa4Tech
1478003690.000002> @U2Q4137LL: Dans les vues invision j'ai déjà intégré les mouvements sur certains boutons quand c'était possible. Quand il n'y pas d'animation c'est que les mouvements proposés sans passer par la version payante ne correspondaient pas.  C'est pour ça que dans le zip il y a toutes les vues avec un texte explicatif sur la gesture à côté.  Au fait la version psd avec tous les éléments séparés n'est pas encore uploader, on hésiter hier entre github ou le drive, du coup je la met ou?
1478005056.000003> @U0B47KC3S: peux-tu me dire les possibilités supplémentaires qu’offre la version payante, dans notre contexte ? par ailleurs <@U04DFTZ7D> pour le choix drive vs github - j’ai un penchant pour drive;)
1478006648.000004> @U2Q4137LL: Sur le site ils ne précisent pas, ils disent juste qu'il y a plus de prototype et options. Mais dans notre cas je ne vois trop d'intérêt, on a très peu d'écrans et animations différentes donc rien qui ne soit compréhensible rapidement par le texte explicatif ou à l'oral
1478024653.000002> @U0B47KC3S: ok on fait comme ça
1478024978.000003> @U0AAL4W13: Niveau stockage de document on a eu cette discussion encore récemment à une réunion du lundi, c'est pas mal de laisser les fichiers accessible au public sur un repo git 
1478024980.000004> @U0AAL4W13: D'autant plus que ça permet de garder le versioning même des fichiers design 
1478025071.000005> @U0AAL4W13: Sachant que l'accès au drive est moins ouvert
1478025106.000006> @U0AAL4W13: Et que pour un camp c'est facile de partager un repo et collecter les contributions de manière visible 
1478201353.000002> @U0B47KC3S: en cours sur un repo qu’on va publier incessamment

1479304208.000005> @U0B47KC3S: <@U04DFTZ7D> <@U0GMX7QUB> I have just pushed on my forked repo of the app, a suggestion of documentation architecture and first examples of what could be the modules and interfaces markdown. What do you think ?
1479304209.000006> @U0B47KC3S: <https://github.com/benchoufi/android-app/tree/master/app/src/main/assets>
1479304348.000008> @U0B47KC3S: [FYI] for all, to explain the precedent post, we are testing a documentation format and for that purpose we attach to some folder of the app, some markdowns files. The idea is that these files will be processed by some script in order to deploy auto-magically the app documentation, at a higher and more intelligible level than a doxygen like doc
1479306187.000010> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U0B47KC3S> looks great and clear !! Just, i don't know why the markdown format don't show up properly when i try to read the MDL-user_interface.   I let <@U0GMX7QUB> telling you about the structure for the automatic website.
1479306288.000011> @U0B47KC3S: what do you mean by they don’t show up properly ?
1479306689.000012> @U04DFTZ7D: Github manage preview of mardown files without showing up the structure of the document. I attached examples

1481936592.000028> @U0B47KC3S: 4 those working on `Vulkan` for `Android`, you should
1481936596.000029> @U0B47KC3S: 1) use last version of `gradle` compiler
1481936599.000030> @U0B47KC3S: 2) Upgrade to last version of Android Studio
1481936614.000031> @U0B47KC3S: 3) If you’re stick with older version such as `1.2.1`, then Android Studio will complain to find `cmake` despite you install latest `SDK Tools` or `SDK build tools`. However, there is a quick fix referenced here &lt;https://github.com/Commit451/android-cmake-installer&gt;
1481936619.000032> @U0B47KC3S: *Remark* It is a known issue of google’s android studio team, which was fixed in latest version

1482005720.000041> @U0B47KC3S: <@U37GZRZU6> <@U1PKXQVDW> after 2 checks, no working Nexus are available on my side :thinking_face:
1482016155.000043> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0B47KC3S> on my side neither... :disappointed:
1482016919.000044> @U0B47KC3S: hey <@U37GZRZU6> there is something in between CPU and GPU usages which is RenderScript. It allows parallel processing. The only thing is we can’t force the code to use either one or another, it is low level OS choice who allocates ressources accordingly to the availibilties. But it seems to be broadly supported from `Jelly Bean` API 16 :wink: And there is a bunch of publications documenting the power of this framework in parallel processing contexts :wink: I am currently jumping in the doc
1482017318.000045> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0B47KC3S> that's great if you found an alternative :slightly_smiling_face: actually I was just thinking, if Vulkan forces people to update to the last Android device / OS then it's not suited for echOpen anyway... right ? The most important criterion to chose the right API is whether it can be widespread or not...
1482017943.000051> @U0B47KC3S: exact <@U37GZRZU6>
1482017948.000052> @U0B47KC3S: 1) the thing is that Google claimed that it is strategic for them to develop an equivalent of IOS’s metal, which is widely supported on IOS devices. So for 2 years, it is announced to be a core evolution of android and supposed to be as widely supported as IOS metal, so that it can meet echOpen’s criterion. Those kind of announces can lead to fast move and quick uptake for the android devices park. But, today’s experience can lead us sure to have a close look on these evolutions but not to rely on this and move forward to another way of hacking around the thing. In between, OpenCL set aside and Vulkan promise, there could be a good alternative in RenderScript (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1482017950.000053> @U0B47KC3S: 2) Btw, guess what, I installed thsi google samples, and this time it work like a charm <https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BasicRenderScript> So that we can begin working on it !
1482018889.000055> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0B47KC3S> thanks a lot !! seems to run on my side as well... can't wait tomorrow to play with it :slightly_smiling_face:
1482023408.000056> @U0B47KC3S: <@U2PFHNN3C> <@U37GZRZU6> <#C1G7T0PNX> look at this
1482023412.000057> @U0B47KC3S: 1) this is called CNNdroid
1482023416.000058> @U0B47KC3S: 2) It is "GPU-Accelerated Execution of Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on Android”
1482023420.000059> @U0B47KC3S: 3) and it uses `RenderScript`!
1482023422.000060> @U0B47KC3S: Published 2 months ago, and Open Source t <https://github.com/ENCP/CNNdroid>
1482075564.000062> @U3FCS2UP3: For me the renderscript examples work as well! So what exactly are the computations that need to be ported to the App?
1482108587.000063> @U0B47KC3S: <@U37GZRZU6> <@U3FCS2UP3> I have just pushed the last version and here is the current state :
1482108592.000064> @U0B47KC3S: 1) It’s working :wink:
1482108597.000065> @U0B47KC3S: 2) We have a pretty good performance of 1,4µs per frame which can let us hope of 70 frames per second for simple images !!
1482108601.000066> @U0B47KC3S: But
1482108608.000067> @U0B47KC3S: 3) The image is slightly noisy, I don’t understand why. You have an idea ?
1482108619.000068> @U0B47KC3S: 4) The code can be still optimized : in fact, I didn’t use the `rs_allocation` because I can’t get the index of the rs_allocation being parsed (the index not the counter). So how to do that ? RenderScript is still poorly documented
1482108623.000069> @U0B47KC3S: btw <@U3FCS2UP3> what I understand is that the loop of the kernel methods which are taken in charge by RenderScript's internals are not the natural increasing order, but rather randomly, which I think explain the images that we got earlier
1482108640.000070> @U0B47KC3S: 5) Btw, when the RenderScript algo will be optimized, I ll make some clean up code to throw out all the allocation in a more static context so that it doesn’t have to be parsed at each loop
1482139231.000074> @U37GZRZU6: you rock <@U0B47KC3S> :wink: I'll have look at the last version, hopefully this evening. BTW, I just told our lead dev about Renderscript, first time of my life I teach him something about Androïd :sunglasses: (reactions: @U0B47KC3S,@U0AAL4W13)

1482189353.000077> @U0B47KC3S: <@U37GZRZU6> yes I use an emulator with API 25, it should not depend on the device, however I use Galaxy Nexus. Could you tell us what you in the logs ? especially the ones marked in red with a thrown exception

1484859431.000121> @U0B47KC3S: hi #channel : just to let you know that we have some jam coding session this saturday afternoon, playing around GPU and renderscript with some echTopians -&gt; <@U37GZRZU6> and <@U3QGT3Q74>
1484859432.000122> @U0B47KC3S: On remote, or irl don’t hesitate to join :wink: (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1484860408.000124> @U3TUWV3SQ: Ok, if I have some free time, I will come. Thanks for the invitation
1484862112.000125> @U3QGT3Q74: Hi all, I will be available on Saturday in early afternoon. I gave a look a renderscript and it looks very promising in term of performances. I also want to mention ITK an other famous open source C++ framework specialized in medical imaging that could be compilated ans used in the Android NDK. It will probably not be as good as renderscript for perfs but it will provide many filters and renderers. Also it would be portable on both iOS and Android 
1484862484.000126> @U0B47KC3S: that’s interesting ! do you think we can implement renderscript + ITK, jus to get filters and renderers if these are necessary, and try to implement them progressively in GPU if there are paralellizable
1484997880.000127> @U3QGT3Q74: I think it's compatible yes. ITK provides automatic parallelization for most of the filters and I know some are also implemented with GPU  (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1484997914.000128> @U3QGT3Q74: I will investigate a bit more 
1484998342.000129> @U0B47KC3S: great :wink:
1484998590.000130> @U38HVMZ6K: For the reference... <https://itk.org/> I also had a quick look at it and seems really good. Well documented and maintained with regular releases. (reactions: @U0B47KC3S)
1485019903.000132> @U0B47KC3S: thanks <@U38HVMZ6K> we were just talking about it. Btw, we arben  trying now to document a robust rendering pipeline
1485020072.000133> @U0B47KC3S: besides, we are working with <@U37GZRZU6> on refactoring the code for the RenderScript implementation and we get for the only ScanConversion algo `6ms` :wink:
1485299669.000134> @U3QGT3Q74: <@U0B47KC3S> <@U37GZRZU6> Following our discussions from last saturday on the rendering pipeline I investigate on the communication part between the device and the mobile phone  * UDP protocol does not seems to be compatible with medical device as it allows packet loss during data transfert, we should focus on TCP/IP   * standard encoding for medical images is Lossless JPEG that ensure no image degradation with a compression factor between 6:1 to 12:1 (reactions: @U20C8CKTL,@U37GZRZU6)
1485299868.000135> @U0B47KC3S: indeed <@U3QGT3Q74>, there is a legacy UDP implementation related to first POCtotype, we used  this protocol for opportunity reason. Currently, we have a TCP implementation running fine
1485299913.000136> @U0B47KC3S: perfect for the JPEG implementation
1485300469.000137> @U20C8CKTL: Last year i saw something at fosdem on picotcp. Some kind of resized tcp/ip stack
1485300513.000138> @U20C8CKTL: Maybe it could be interesting to look at this stuff further.
1485335873.000139> @U0AAL4W13: BTW, were there minutes from Saturday?
1485335906.000140> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0AAL4W13> no... :sweat:
1485445049.000141> @U0B47KC3S: :point_up: <@U37GZRZU6> <@U3QGT3Q74> <@U2X7189QR> <@U3FCS2UP3> <@U2XLJS5L0>  I have just PR with a new branch `GPUrway`
1485445052.000142> @U0B47KC3S: You’ll find the app with RenderScript all together with OpenGL display machinery :wink: it is morning work so there is still some screen parameters to find tune in order to get a bigger picture, but it is speed and works like a charm :wink:
1485445054.000143> @U0B47KC3S: Morever you’ll find OpenGL test android app, a standalone one, in order to play with it without embrassing with the heavy echOpen’s app (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1485445754.000144> @U3QGT3Q74: <@U0B47KC3S> I'm currently setting up the mobile-app repository of the project. I will also give a look at GPUrway branch :wink:
1485447093.000145> @U0B47KC3S: <@U3QGT3Q74> great :wink: we agree that I am not an expert and so not quality code compliant :wink: pleasing myself with some code, that’s it

1490004135.052982> @U3QGT3Q74: Hi everybody, I gave a look at the high level Android app architecture. Google recommendations are MVP or MVVM design and you can find from simple to more complex examples on this github: <https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture>. (reactions: @U20C8CKTL,@U3GHS132Q,@U0B47KC3S)
1490004355.100679> @U3QGT3Q74: To my point of view, a good balance between code verbosity and quality would be to use MVP design pattern with dependencies injection using Dagger 2 frameworks
1490007094.669708> @U0B47KC3S: perfect !! I think I have already some Dagger things running in some branch :wink:
1490007112.673280> @U3GHS132Q: I am slowly currently trying to branch the new UI (phaino branch on github) to the current backend. It seems to be a big project so I think that we all have to discuss about it.  I discuss it a few with <@U3QGT3Q74> , is it possible to plan a meetup to discuss off it more clearly ?
1490092538.047785> @U0B47KC3S: <@U3GHS132Q> let’s discuss about it tomorrow evening !

1491644827.337546> @U37GZRZU6: Same here, 2pm is ok! anyway I'll have to pass by Hôtel Dieu, but let's brainstorm for a nice place nearby? Waiting for confirmation from <@U0B47KC3S> <@U3GHS132Q> ;) ( <@U0AAL4W13>  you're not available today right?)

1491647411.443216> @U0B47KC3S: we can go to le café Rostand at luxembourg
1491647810.459489> @U3GHS132Q: I do not agree with terrace !  It is a manipulation, <@U37GZRZU6> will profit that the sun hits our heads to manipulate us ! I think that it is a better idea to relocate echOpen in catacombs !
1491647894.462625> @U3GHS132Q: More seriously I am ok with terrace if it is not expensive and if I can see my screen (my machine has not an IPS screen) (reactions: @U0AAL4W13)
1491648015.467631> @U3GHS132Q: I have an idea for where to go but I do not think that it will be comfy to code, moreover we will not have fairy electricity :s

1491648798.498252> @U3GHS132Q: Is it possible to charge machines at this cafe ???
1491649708.536463> @U37GZRZU6: Let's go for it and change if it's not possible?

1492384670.412089> @U3GHS132Q: If I do not say somethibg wrong an app for tablet and smartphone are the same
1492384702.414132> @U3GHS132Q: If therr is any difference it is in term of UI so it will no take long time to develop for tablet
1492407851.510453> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt; an app for tablet and smartphone are the same &gt; If therr is any difference it is in term of UI so it will no take long time to develop for tablet An Android app is most often the same for tablet and smartphone (same APK) but.. 1) with no special consideration, a smartphone app often looks ugly on a tablet (reduced size of widgets, bad usability,...) 2) UX considerations are a bit different between smartphones and tablets. e.g. smartphones are mostly used with one hand in portrait orientation while tablets are often used wit two hands in landscape mode
1492407940.519172> @U38HVMZ6K: The 2 devices are fundamentally difference in terms of UX. While we can well imagine the use with a smartphone (probe in one hand, smartphone in the other for visualization and control e.g. gain) the use of a tablet would be different.
1492408010.526322> @U38HVMZ6K: The big advantage of the tablet is the screen size which would radically improve the comfort for visulaization. On the other side, holding the tablet in one and the probe in the other is quite difficult.
1492408360.561065> @U38HVMZ6K: We can imagine 2 use cases: 1) Use the tablet "static" on a table as display and implement vocal commands for gain, frequency,... control 2) Use a tablet grip with "free thumb" and put all controls on the margin (reachable with the thumb only): <http://lazy-hands.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Tablet-gripx1-black21-800x800.png> (reactions: @U0AAL4W13)
1492408625.588808> @U38HVMZ6K: For detailed information, see official Android documentation: <https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/tablets-and-handsets.html> In short, it is possible to support both but this needs consideration right from the beginning.
1492428517.984318> @U3GHS132Q: &gt; Use the tablet "static" on a table as display and implement vocal commands for gain, frequency,... control You search complicated. Take the Ultramark, replace the screen by a detachable tablet and the probe by a wireless probe. With this setup the practitioner has a free hand (the one which does not hold the probe).  I even think that this setup will be more comfy than smartphone/probe (seriously handle a big phone with the non writing hand is a pain). But it can not be used anywhere.  &gt; put all controls on the margin The design of the phaino branch in git has controls on margin.
1492429882.134905> @U3GHS132Q: And I am just thinking that it could be possible to other people to develop app for our devices because the communication will be documented. So if people have a very specific UX, for example using the probe while doing headstand, they will develop their own app to use the probe in this manner.
1492430306.182795> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt; it could be possible to other people to develop app for our devices because the communication will be documented &gt; they will develop their own app to use the probe in this manner Not for a medical device... For hackers and open source/open hardware community yes, it would be possible but if you think about a real medical application, you won't ever have an app developed by individuals or a community. That's just impossible to pass through certification (MDR/CE in Europe, 510(k) in US and other regulations in other parts of the world).
1492430388.193086> @U3GHS132Q: People do what they want. Our app has to be certified but if a private clinic or a small group of maker want to develop their own app : let them do it
1492430723.236685> @U38HVMZ6K: Well, that's not as easy as that... Having a public and documented API which can be used by anyone may be problematic, even more if it is on a wireless link. We should at least guarantee that it is our own certified application which is controlling the probe and not an app developed by Mr Lambda in his spare time with poor programming skills. The fact of having an open and accessible API will be very very difficult to argue to regulations authorities. How do you prevent unauthorized access to your device ? How do you mitigate cybersecurity risks, privacy and health information security ?
1492430780.243895> @U3GHS132Q: &gt; How do you mitigate cybersecurity risks, privacy and health information security ? By encrypting data ?
1492430820.248947> @U3GHS132Q: &gt; The fact of having an open and accessible API will be very very difficult to argue to regulations authorities If we are not certified because our app and device are open source they can for sure go fuck themselves with their certification :slightly_smiling_face:
1492431122.286102> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt; they can for sure go fuck themselves with their certification Unfortunately, they decide and not you... And they don't care at all if you get their certification or not. At the end of the day, you are the butt of the joke because you cannot market your device...
1492431246.301198> @U38HVMZ6K: But if you are convinced that you can make them change their mind and have an open device with an open API usable by anyone,  I cannot prevent you of doing so but in my opinion it's just a run straight into the wall.
1492431496.333042> @U3GHS132Q: &gt; market your device The objective for me is not to market something it is to save life with open source and low cost probe.  &gt; run straight into the wall If you run into a wall with enough speed you can break it
1492431636.350864> @U3GHS132Q: But before speaking of that we will develop our app and try to make it certified. But I will never write proprietary code to please some certification group which are possibly corrupted by lobbying of some big companies.
1492433520.621851> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt; The objective for me is not to market something it is to save life with open source and low cost probe. If you don't agree with the term "market" just replace it with "legally use for free" and you get  &gt; At the end of the day, you are the butt of the joke because you cannot legally use for free your device...
1492433589.632883> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt;  to please some certification group which are possibly corrupted by lobbying of some big companies. What do you propose then ? Create an open source regulation community recognized by governments for legalizing use of medical devices ?
1492433963.696745> @U3GHS132Q: &gt; legally use for free Without certification we can also save lives   &gt; Create an open source regulation community recognized by governments for legalizing use of medical devices This is an excellent idea !
1492434612.820137> @U38HVMZ6K: Good luck!
1492434779.852826> @U3GHS132Q: I will not try to do this because I have not the time do this nor the competences. But open source regulation consortium are always better than closed one
1492449237.003792> @U4YCKBDR8: Musicians use tablet holders like this: <https://produkte.k-m.de/media/images/product/19742-300-55_Detail_5.jpg> , it makes the tablet controllable by one hand, while holding the probe in the other. I think the bigger screen is really beneficial for this application, but indeed UI design will need to be completely different.
1492449768.176896> @U4YCKBDR8: As for certification; having experience in a medical devices company, I can assure you this will not be easy. FDA for example (if you can get FDA approval, the rest will follow) needs you to have a really large body of documentation not only about the design, but also for example about all processes involved in quality assurance, bug handling, design process, introducing new features, handling complaints by customers,... I am very curious about what projects like this one are going to do when they really want to go to a market, but I can hardly see any other way than some company investing a lot of money to do all the "paperwork" and then start selling. (reactions: @U38HVMZ6K,@U0AAL4W13)
1492450869.549316> @U38HVMZ6K: <@U4YCKBDR8> I am currently working as an R&amp;D Software Engineer in a medical device company and, luckily or not, know well what you are describing. We already have a huge amount of documentation following strict processes under design controls. We are currently in our final development phase and already preparing ourselves for V&amp;V which is planned to start end of this year to finally submit a 510(k) to the FDA. I try to bring insights into medical device development and processes as far as I can and propose methodologies and processes which could allow an easier design transfer to a company eventually taking over the certification process. I see it exactly as you do... Without a company investing much time, money and effort, the chances to see a device in the field are tight.
1492451206.662970> @U38HVMZ6K: BTW, did you already successfully passed through the whole FDA process? Personally and for my whole team it will be a first shot... We are (I think) well prepared and have a full software lifecycle process, quality system and assurance procedures,... But as long as we don't submit, we are a bit in the dark on what FDA expectations are and to which extent we fullfil them.
1492451616.802581> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt; (if you can get FDA approval, the rest will follow) I think this was true until recently but Europe with its new regulations (MDR: medical device regulation) is now as harsh as FDA even worse in some domains.
1492452548.132511> @U4YCKBDR8: I worked as an R&amp;D Engineer on image processing technology for radiology images (<http://global.agfahealthcare.com/main/digital-radiography/>) and yes, Agfa has FDA approved radiology systems up and running in the field for a long time. I witnessed closely (although not directly involved) how an FDA auditor came to our offices for a week and the panic and fear this caused by many of my colleagues, especially the ones who created all the documentation and processes. For us, R&amp;D engineers, it was a matter of documenting every little piece of change you make and making sure everything was traceable according to the processes, but if you have to setup the whole 510(k) from scratch, I understand you feel a bit in the dark! (reactions: @U38HVMZ6K,@U0AAL4W13,@U0B47KC3S)
1492452738.197164> @U38HVMZ6K: thanks for sharing your experience (even if it worries me even more about FDA inspectors audits :wink:)
1492452853.234876> @U4YCKBDR8: Don't worry, things will work out ;-); what are you working on?
1492452861.237784> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt; Digital Radiography: DR &amp; CR powered by MUSICA Very nice devices and technology !

1492453138.331780> @U38HVMZ6K: yep, fun and challenging... all constraints of a medical device development + constraints of a product to be used by patients at home (= not healthcare professionals, not a clean environment as in clinics,...)
1492453165.341348> @U4YCKBDR8: You're in Switzerland, home of all things made with high quality! Great :slightly_smiling_face:
1492454320.742465> @U38HVMZ6K: :sweat_smile: we try to at least
1493218908.820399> @U0B47KC3S: :mega::confetti_ball::rocket::nerd_face: the last PR on the android_app repo is the final cut of the version , currently git-tagged as `classic`. Big Up to <@U3QGT3Q74> . The app handles the data coming in from the redpitaya, the envelope detection and the scanconversion. We are now jumping to the next version, mainly merge the current backend into the UI developed by the phaino team :wink: (reactions: @U0AAL4W13,@U37GZRZU6,@U20C8CKTL)

1493812285.699408> @U38HVMZ6K: In the other project running in my company they develop an Android app and they mostly use the testing tools provided by the Android SDK itself. Espresso and UI Automator for UI testing (<https://developer.android.com/studio/test/index.html>) and monkeyrunner for stress testing (<https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkeyrunner/index.html>)
1493812357.713191> @U38HVMZ6K: I'm not involved at all in these activities but from what I hear from them, the tools are quite confortable to use.
1493812408.722758> @U38HVMZ6K: what they particularly like is the good integration within Android Studio
1494348966.727851> @U3GHS132Q: <http://www.numerama.com/tech/256382-google-sapprete-a-sortir-une-beta-publique-dandroid-o.html> Go go (power rangers) you have 6 months to port the app on Android O (and use the PIP mode) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
1494351171.480847> @U0B47KC3S: yep, there are indeed a few nice features
