1442925459.000003> @U0AAL4W13: <@U04DFTZ7D>: tu penses que le PDF que tu as ajouté au wiki on peut le mettre en full text ?
1442925488.000004> @U0AAL4W13: enfin, mettre le contenu du doc en page wiki
1442926487.000005> @U04DFTZ7D: Oui, on peut si on ne laisse pas tout le monde changer le contenu :wink:
1442926930.000006> @U0AAL4W13: On verra de ttes facons, ou une fois loggué on peut protéger la page

1445499768.000002> @U0AAL4W13: <@U04DFTZ7D>: j'archive temporairement le basecamp juridique si ca te va, je vais créer un pour FPGA
1445499804.000003> @U0AAL4W13: BTW, t'as le doc de la license en éditable? Au pire tu me l'envoie je le mets demain sur le wiki comme on avait discuté

1478627193.000002> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U0AAL4W13>, i prefer we discuss this topic in the right channel it will be easier for everybody to have structured information.
1478627211.000003> @U04DFTZ7D: 
1478627261.000004> @U04DFTZ7D: Concerning the questions asked there were two and i mentioned, we planed on finishing the work by November the 16th. So as soon as it will be done, it will be shared to all.
1478627306.000005> @U0AAL4W13: Sure thing.
1478627310.000006> @U04DFTZ7D: Great :wink:
1478627449.000007> @U04DFTZ7D: To organize a workshop, we first need to precise what we want to achieve and what are our needs precisely. And then we will mobilize jurists to help the community and enlighten us during our discussions.
1478627543.000008> @U0AAL4W13: I'll be copying the exchanges we had with <@U1NM17NHF> on basecamp too here
1478627580.000009> @U04DFTZ7D: Because it has become unclear to me. We have already setup licences (one for the hardware and one for the software) after the community discussed about this matter. And i imagine that when a contributor wants to contribute, he will then push its contribution under the dedicated licence, no ?
1478627766.000010> @U0AAL4W13: The aim of the CLA.md file is to have the same info on what are CLAs, you'll find an answer to your question :)
1478627829.000011> @U0AAL4W13: It makes sense also to gather the info from all who provided inputs to this question, including those jurist. There is no clear justification (to me) of the current stance towards copyright assignment. 
1478627904.000012> @U0AAL4W13: Last but not least, the echOpen license itself is inconsistent with a position of copyright assignment (which is the association position as of today).
1478628508.000013> @U04DFTZ7D: Just to give some context the licence has been established before the association by the community including you <@U0AAL4W13>. And for my part I agree with the idea of setting up a workshop to clarify all this and considering the idea of a CLA, which I find a good idea. So as you were ready to organize it <@U0AAL4W13>, please go. Just start by setting up the challenge (context, problem and ideas of solutions) then, if needed we will ask some jurists to review the workshop document and launch the workshop inviting bustiers and the community. Is that fine for you ?
1478628633.000014> @U0AAL4W13: Nope, I really want to have at least some discussion with the jurists in question to understand their position: it would be useless to prepare a workshop to which a legal advisor says "that's true but not applicable to echopen because Xxxxx" in which case it'd be a loss of time for everyone. 
1478628643.000015> @U0AAL4W13: Also, I hate unprepared meetings :)
1478628830.000016> @U04DFTZ7D: I agree !! That is the reason why we need to first document the question and prepare everything to avoid wasting their time, I mean the jurists as they are very busy in general. 
1478628975.000018> @U0AAL4W13: We're all busy :) That's why the CLA.md file has been compiled,  for a first sharing amongst us. It's always better to be able to get to know stuff before the meeting. Don't hesitate to comment about this doc. Sort of a online meeting preparation, if you want.
1478629086.000019> @U0AAL4W13: Good link BTW is : <https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/ppt_CLA.md> :smiley:
1479302857.000002> @U04DFTZ7D: The Open Hardware practical guide we are working on is a little bit late to reach its final version… After having talked with the team, we need to set up a few more meetings to finalize the document. I’ll let you know about the release date soon.
